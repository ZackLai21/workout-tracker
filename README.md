# workout-tracker

## Description
This app is a workout tracker. It allows users to create and view their daily workouts. This app also has a stats page to show the total duration of each workout, and the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts.

The front-end is built by HTML and CSS. The routes are built by Express, and I use Mongo databse to store the data.

Run this command to start the application's server
